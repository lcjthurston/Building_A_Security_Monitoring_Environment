# Building_A_Security_Monitoring_Environment
This is a Defensive Security project designed around a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization (VSI). In Phase 1, I used Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution for the fictional org. In Phase 2, several simulated attacks were launched to determined whether the monitoring solution would really protect the organization. In Phase 3, the results of this project were presented to a group of cybersecurity analysts to gauge its effectiveness.



## Project Headshot
### Phase 1: Solution Design
Load and analyze Windows logs.<br>
Create reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Windows logs.<br>
Load and analyze Apache logs.<br>
Create reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Apache logs.<br>
Install an add-on Splunk application for additional monitoring.<br>

### Phase 2: Attack Simulation
Load Windows attack logs.<br>
Analyze Windows attack logs.<br>
Load Apache attack logs.<br>
Analyze Apache attack logs.<br>

### Phase 3: Project Showcase
Information security continuous monitoring (ISCM)<br>
Log types and how they are used for monitoring<br>
Log aggregation and correlation<br>
Baselining<br>
SIEMS & Splunk<br>
